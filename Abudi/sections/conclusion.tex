\subsection{Connection to the Next Chapter}

Since the entire communication architecture is based on MQTT to ensure real-time performance and reliability, the system avoids the complexities of hybrid protocol management. The following chapter details the trade-offs between MQTT and REST, and how the IoT Sync mechanism leverages this MQTT foundation to ensure seamless data synchronization.
