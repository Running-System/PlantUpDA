\subsection{Background and Context}
To get user hooked onto ones application is one of the most important factors for software success.

Getting users interested in a normal activity is where gamification can help.

This thesis analyzes the concept of gamification and how it is applied within ``Plant Up!'', a smart gardening system designed to assist users in caring for their plants. 

\subsection{Research Question}
To systematically address these challenges this thesis poses the following primary research question:

\textit{How can gamification be effectively applied to a gardening system to keep users more engaged in a normal activity?}
