\section{Evaluation \& Discussion}

\subsection{Expected Engagement Improvements}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Increased daily active users:} Gamification features like streaks are expected to drive daily logins.
    \item \textbf{Longer session duration:} Interactive elements and progression systems encourage users to spend more time in the app.
    \item \textbf{Better plant care consistency:} Reminder quests and rewards aim to regularize care activities, leading to healthier plants.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Risks \& Limitations}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Users gaming the system:} Users might perform unnecessary actions just to earn points (e.g., over-watering).
    \item \textbf{Motivation drop after novelty:} The engagement spike from new features may fade ("novelty effect").
    \item \textbf{Balance issues:} Ensuring rewards feel earned but attainable is difficult to fine-tune.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Comparison to Non-Gamified Apps}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Traditional gardening apps:} Focus solely on information and scheduling.
    \item \textbf{Why they lose users:} Lack of immediate feedback and emotional hook leads to abandonment when the initial enthusiasm fades or the task becomes a chore.
\end{itemize}
